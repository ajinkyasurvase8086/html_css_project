        <span style="font-weight: bolder ;"> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </span> 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was
        an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India
        from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and
        studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
        decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
        Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
        Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
        space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
        came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
        development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4]
        He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role
        in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
        original nuclear test by India in 1974.
